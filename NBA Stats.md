# NBA Stats

I'm a huge fan of the NBA and they are on the cutting-edge of data collection in sports. They track ball and player movements 25 times a second and use this unstructured data to define all kinds of statistics, segmented by any category you can think of (lineups, play type, game situation, etc.)

This data is readily available on their website, which is a boon to anyone that loves basketball and analytics. It is a great subject area for me to learn new techniques and tools as I grow as a data scientist.

There are several ideas I am working on and will share any interesting projects in the future.

If you have any ideas or projects you'd like to work on, feel free to reach out.

# Team Performance Project

[This is a project](http://rpubs.com/Robert_Fields/NBATeamPerformance) I completed last summer for an Introduction to R class in the Wake Forest MSBA program. It was a personal project each of us selected in order to practice the concepts we learned in class.
