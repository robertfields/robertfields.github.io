I am a graduate student pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at the [Wake Forest University School of Business](http://business.wfu.edu) and I'm interested in consulting, financial services, tech, and sports analytics.

I've loved optimization and predictive modeling ever since I started studying Economics in my undergraduate education at Wake Forest. I began my professional career using large data sets to inform smarter business decisions and create innovative solutions to constantly improve on these decisions.

This experience while working at companies like [Red Ventures](https://redventures.com) has driven me to invest more in my love for problem solving. I'm looking for opportunities in data science, basketball analytics, strategic consulting, financial analytics, and other related fields.

I'll keep you updated with some of my work on different projects in the sidebar. If you're interested in what I can offer and doing some great work together, please reach out to me via:
