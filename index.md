[Wake Forest University School of Business](http://business.wfu.edu)

I am a graduate student pursuing a Masters in Business Analytics at Wake Forest University School of Business and I'm interested in consulting, financial services, tech, and sports analytics.

I've loved optimization and predictive modeling ever since I was first exposed to the topics while studying Economics in my undergraduate education at Wake Forest. I began my professional career using large data sets to inform smarter business decisions and create innovative solutions to constantly improve on these decisions.

This experience while working at companies like Red Ventures has driven me to invest more in my love for problem solving and leveraging economic theory in the real world. I'm looking for opportunities in data science, basketball analytics, strategic consulting, financial analytics, and other related fields.

If you are interested in collaborating and doing some great work please reach out to me via:
